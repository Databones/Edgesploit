Shift+D to hide & show the menu icon.


## Does this script skip videos? 🎥
Sometimes. It depends on chance. Videos are inconsistent, so it may not skip at all and you will have to watch the video, yet other times, it may complete instructions in seconds. Another small example is Frame Advance, which allows you to cut around 8 seconds off each video.


## The script is not working. ❓
You can troubleshoot by doing the following:
- Right click TamperMonkey and go to "Options", click "Settings", and set Config mode to "Advanced".
- Check if "Include script storage" is enabled. Find it in "Utilities".
- Update your browser to the latest version.
- Try using different browsers. Recommend to start off using Google Chrome (the browser Edgesploit has been tested on).

## Theres are several errors shown in TamperMonkey. ❓
This is normal and is caused by the script being compressed. The script should run good.


## Duplicate Tabs is not working. ❓
Open new activities more slowly as the script needs time to inject onto the page.
