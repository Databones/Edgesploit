## How do you install Edgesploit? üìú
Start by doing the following:
1. Install the script managing extension [TamperMonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo).
2. Install the Edgesploit script [here](https://github.com/Databones/Edgesploit/raw/main/Edgesploit.user.js).
3. Log into Edgenuity and Edgesploit should automatically be injected into the site. Check for the logo on the bottom right corner.

## The script is not working. ‚ùì
You can troubleshoot by doing the following:
- Right click TamperMonkey and go to "Options", click "Settings", and set Config mode to "Advanced".
- Check if "Include script storage" is enabled. Find it in "Utilities".
- Update your browser to the latest version.
- Try using different browsers. Recommend to start off using Google Chrome (the browser Edgesploit has been tested on).

## Any keybinds?
Shift+Z to open & close the menu
Shift+D to hide & show the menu icon.


## Theres are several errors in the script.
This is due to the script being compressed, and it's completely normal. The script will run fine.


## Duplicate tabs is not working.
Open new activities slower as the script needs time time load onto the page.


## Does this script skip videos?
Yes. But it depends on the class. Edgenuity videos are very inconsistent so sometimes it may not skip at all and you will have to watch the video, but other times, it can complete instructions in seconds. Another case of video skipping is that Frame Advance allows you to shave 8 seconds off each video.
