## How do you install Edgesploit? üìú
Start by doing the following:
1. Install the script managing extension [TamperMonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo).
2. Install the Edgesploit script [here](https://github.com/Databones/Edgesploit/raw/main/Edgesploit.user.js).
3. Log into Edgenuity and Edgesploit should automatically be injected into the site. Check for the logo on the bottom right corner.

## The script is not working. ‚ùì
You can troubleshoot by doing the following:
- Right click TamperMonkey and go to "Options", click "Settings", and set Config mode to "Advanced".
- Check if "Include script storage" is enabled. Find it in "Utilities".
- Update your browser to the latest version.
- Try using different browsers. Recommend to start off using Google Chrome (the browser Edgesploit has been tested on).

## Any keybinds?
Shift+X to open & close the menu
Shift+D to hide & show the menu icon.


## Theres are several errors in the script.
This is normal and is caused by the script being compressed. The script will run fine.


## Duplicate tabs is not working.
Open new activities more slowly as the script needs¬†time to inject¬†onto the page.


## Does this script skip videos?
Sometimes. It depends on chance. Edgenuity videos are inconsistent, so it may not skip at all and you will have to watch the video, yet other times, it may complete instructions in seconds. Another small example is Frame Advance, which allows you to cut around¬†8 seconds off¬†each video.
